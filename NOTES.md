##Problem Statement

####WHO has the problem
Conference _users_ are: attendees, organizers, staff (volunteers) and guests (presenters)

####WHAT is the problem
Attendees need a way to
- navigate the conference events and plan their agenda
- network with each other
- get related information about restaurant and activity recommendations, travel and lodging tips, etc
Organizers need
- attendees get the most value out of the conference
- a single online location to direct attendees to for conference chatting
- a historical record of what attendees learned (how they benefitted)

Scheduling is a huge problem (but not in our MVP)
