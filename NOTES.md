## Vision
Our application will serve as a modern message board for attendees at conferences and conventions that can be customized to a host organizations's branding and needs.

#### WHO has the problem
Conference _users_ are: attendees, organizers, staff (volunteers) and guests (presenters)

#### WHAT is the problem
Attendees need a way to
- navigate the conference events and plan their agenda
- network with each other
- get related information about restaurant and activity recommendations, travel and lodging tips, etc

Organizers need
- attendees get the most value out of the conference
- a single online location to direct attendees to for conference chatting
- a historical record of what attendees learned (how they benefitted)

Scheduling is a huge problem (but not in our MVP)



## Proposed Solution (summary)


## Scope (features list)


## Milestones
Up until first alpha release and date


## Schedule
- 3-Fri:

## Strategy
1. Create a chat-style message board in which conference attendees' posts appear in a single location but are easily filtered by topics of interest.
### Operations

-Message board is filterable by topic
-New post view allows user to submit to master board, add pre-defined topics from menu
-User names on master board are clickable and display user contact info
-User can return to past posts and edit/delete their content

## Strategy
2. API endpoints can be used by a host organization to build a custom UI in addition to using our application's built-in UI.
### Operations
-API is clearly documented for ease of adaptation
-Test suite for API is included for ease of use

## Strategy
3. Conference schedule with favoriting capabilities
